# Reading group

## Schedule
- TBD

## Applications series
- [Environmentally Controlled Invasion of Cancer Cells by Engineered Bacteria (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283605013380)

## Foundational advances series
- [Genetic parts to program bacteria (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166906001273)
  - Gives a survey of parts and part types for programming genetic circuits.
  - [Control of gene expression by a natural metabolite-responsive ribozyme (2004)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02362)
    - RNA aptamers can control expression of ribozymes that can then regulate transcript expression.
  - [Programmable ligand-controlled riboregulators of eukaryotic gene expression](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1069)
    - RNA aptamers can interfere with ribosome-binding sites to regulate translation.
  - [Engineered riboregulators enable post-transcriptional control of gene expression (2004)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt986)
    - Hairpins are designed to sequester ribosome-binding site and thus to inhibit translation. This inhibition is overcome by the transcription of a small regulatory RNA from a second promoter.
  - Cascades
    - [Noise Propagation in Gene Networks | Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1109090)
      - The authors study how a noisy upstream part of a gene network will influence the downstream parts to which it is connected.
    - [Ultrasensitivity and noise propagation in a synthetic transcriptional cascade (2004)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0408507102)
      - A three-stage transcriptional cascade is constructed. The transfer function and cell-to-cell variation is measured at each stage.
  - [The Coherent Feedforward Loop Serves as a Sign-sensitive Delay Element in Transcription Networks (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603012038)
    - Feedforward circuits can filter out short pulses of input.
  - Cell-cell communication
    - [A synthetic multicellular system for programmed pattern formation | Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03461)
      - Vibrio fischeri luxIR circuit is used to create sender and receiver cells that create two-dimensional patterns.
    - [Programmed population control by cell–cell communication and regulated killing | Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02491)
      - Linking _luxIR_ genes to _ccdB_ gene to induce cell death once a certain population density is reached.
    - [Dual selection enhances the signaling specificity of a variant of the quorum-sensing transcriptional activator LuxR | Nature Biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1209)
      - The researchers use directed evolution to alter the specificity of a quorum sensor to respond to different small molecules. This opens up multiple channels by which cells can be programmed to communicate.
  - Optimizing circuits
    - [Optimizing Genetic Circuits by Global Sensitivity Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349504736978)
      - An algorithm is developed to determine the parameters in a circuit model that should be targeted for mutagenesis to achieve a desired property.
    - [Transcriptional regulation by the numbers: models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X05000304), [Transcriptional regulation by the numbers: applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X05000298)
      - The physiochemical basis for the transfer function of a promoter is described.
  - Large-scale cloning
    - [Combining two genomes in one cell: Stable cloning of the Synechocystis PCC6803 genome in the Bacillus subtilis 168 genome (2005)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0503868102)
